first time right software delivery process:

	Writing Unit testing:
	For Legacy Code, write unit testing to coverve business logic, if require do refactoring and rearchitecting to make the application testable.
	For new development, Evangalize benifits of unit testing and make sure they follow TDD for their development.
	
	Run static code analysis and extended release management tool for each release and compare it with previous release.
	
	Implement CICD pipeline
	
	Validate CICD pipeline Against DevOps Maturity Model
	
	technical final inspection:	
		Extended release management tool (which compares the results of two static code analysis reports and show the issues in newly added code)
		Test Management Tool (This is not fully automated. some time we will get the defect count from QA team)
